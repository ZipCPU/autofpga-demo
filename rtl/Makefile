## Filename: 	bench/rtl/Makefile
##
## Project:	dbgbus, a collection of 8b channel to WB bus debugging protocols
##
## Purpose:	This Makefile guides the translation of the project RTL files
##		into a library (Vmain__ALL.a) file that can then be linked
##	with our C++ test-bench driver routine.
##
## Targets:
##
##	verilate
##		This target runs Verilator to produce its files in $(VDIRFB)
##		(i.e. in obj_dir).  This target depends upon the projects
##		verilog files.
##
##	library
##		This target tells make to CD into the $(VDIRFB) (i.e. obj_dir)
##		directory created by verilator, and to run make on the
##		Verilator produced output.  The result is a V(*)__ALL.a file
##		that we can then link with later.

# all, the first target, becomes the default target
all:
#
# We'll place into the $(BUS) variable which (of possibly multiple) debugging
# bus we want to test.  (Around here, I've also got wbubus and exbus as options,
# options that are not yet in the repository ... if they ever will be.)
BUS ?= hexbus
#
# Verilator places everything into obj_dir by default.  By creating a variable
# with this name, we can adjust it and everything will adjust as appropriate
VDIRFB  := obj_dir
#
# We'll need to call make in subdirectories.  Here's how we're going to do it.
# The actual call will need to look like $(SUBMAKE) <directory> <target>
SUBMAKE := $(MAKE) --no-print-directory -C
#
# In case you have verilator in a strange place that's not necessarily in your
# path, we allow it to be overridden here.
VERILATOR := verilator
#
# Verilator flags
#	-Wall	Turn all warnings on, and stop on a warning as if an error
#	--MMD	Build/update a dependency file, so we know when we need to
#		rebuild
#	-trace	Build a VCD generation facility into Verilator's output
#	-y <dir> Let verilator know that some of our source is in the <dir>
#		directory
#	--Mdir <dir>	Place our output files into <dir>, or $(VDIRFB) here
#	-cc	Create C++ output files (in $(VDIRFB)
#
VFLAGS= -Wall --MMD -trace $(AUTOVDIRS) --Mdir $(VDIRFB) -cc

#
# Now that all of our defines are out of the way, we'll specify two default
# targets.  The first just runs verilator.  The second actually builds our
# library within the $(VDIRFB) directory
